      <h3>Colombian cuisine history</h3>
      <p>Colombia is a very large country with very diverse regions and people, and as a result, the types of food served in different areas can vary, but it is all quite good.<br>
        Much of the food of Colombia includes some degree of Spanish influence since the country was colonized by the Spanish.<br>        
        Slaves were also brought to this part of the world in large numbers, and as a result, African influence can be seen in Colombian food culture as well.<br>        
        Furthermore, indigenous people have lived in the area for thousands of years and also played a big role in the development of Colombian cuisine of today.<br>       
        Combine these things with the vast variety of ingredients offered by the sea, the rainforest and the mountains, and you will begin to understand the reasons that Colombian food is as wonderful as it is.</p>

      <h3>Japanese cuisine history</h3>
      <p>Different food traditions of other nations have influenced the Japanese cuisine, it is known that Chinese people showed Japanese how to cultivate rice in 300 B.C. No wonder that Chinese showed how to use chopsticks, as well as introduced the usage of soy sauce and tofu in everyday life.<br>        
        Later in 700 A.D., meat consumption was prohibited by Buddhists. Buddhism introduced dishes made from raw fish and rice to Japanese people.<br>        
        In 1200-s, trade between the different countries has become popular. Japanese cuisine mixed with Dutch and Portuguese. It incorporated potatoes, corn, and sweet potatoes. Then, a frying technique “tempura” became popular.<br>        
        During the 20th century, Japanese cuisine involved bread, ice cream, coffee and other western foods. Nevertheless, Japanese still cherish their traditions and opt for classic cooking recipes.</p>

      <h3>Mexican cuisine history</h3>
      <p>It is believed that authentic Mexican food might have been derived from the Mayan Indians. They were traditionally nomadic hunters and gatherers. Corn tortillas with bean paste were a common food item; but they also ate wild game, tropic fruits, and fish.<br>
        In the mid 1300's, The Aztec Empire was thriving, and though the Mayan food staples were still in use, chili peppers, honey, salt and chocolate found its way into their cooking. Some of the wild game, such as turkey and duck, had now become domesticated.<br>        
        In 1521 Spain invaded Mexico. Spanish foods had the most influence on the Mexican cuisine. They introduced new livestock, such as sheep, pigs and cows. They brought with them dairy products, and garlic as well as many different herbs, wheat and spices.<br> 
        It was at this time that the Mexican people saw the assimilation of many other cuisines including Caribbean, South American, French, West African and Portuguese. Because of this Mexican foods today are diverse, yet dishes to vary from region to region.</p>

      <h3>Turkish cuisine history</h3>
      <p>The Turkish people are descendents of nomadic tribes from Mongolia and western Asia who moved westward and became herdsmen around A.D. 600. Early influence from the Chinese and Persians included noodles and manti , cheese- or meat-stuffed dumplings (similar to the Italian ravioli), Turkeyoften covered in a yogurt sauce.<br> 
        Manti has often been credited with first introducing dolma (stuffed foods) into the Turkish cuisine. The milk and various dairy products that became staple foods for the herdsmen were nearly unused by the Chinese. This difference helped the Turks to establish their own unique diet.<br>
        By A.D. 1000, the Turks were moving westward towards richer soil where they grew crops such as wheat and barley. Thin sheets of dough called yufka along with crushed grains were used to create sweet pastries. The Persians introduced rice, various nuts, and meat and fruit stews.<br>
        As the Turks moved further westward into Anatolia (present-day Turkey) by 1200, they encountered chickpeas and figs, as well as Greek olive oil and an abundance of seafood.</p>
